# BHI160 Sensor Hub Arduino library

## Sensor Overview

The BHI160 is a small, low-power smart-hub with an integrated three axis gyroscope, an integrated three axis accelerometer, and a programmable microcontroller. Containing pre-installed software and specific algorithms for activity recognition it is specifically designed to enable always-on motion sensing. It perfectly matches the requirements of smartphones, wearables or any other application which demands accurate, real-time motion data at very low power consumption. The device integrates our best-in-class 6-axis IMU (BMI160) with an MCU – the new Bosch Sensortec Fuser core. It is bringing you the full Android sensor stack inside your devices – even without having an Android OS or an Android environment. Combining this with the built in computing power and the highly configurable on-board memory the BHI160 offers you a low power solution for motion sensing and data processing. Software binaries included!

### Applications

- Activity recognition of standing, walking, running, biking or in vehicle
- Step-counting, Indoor navigation and PDR
- HMI interfaces incl. gesture detection of motion, tilt, pickup, wake up, glance or other gestures for wearables
- Augmented reality, immersive gaming and tilt-compensated eCompass
- Full 9DoF data fusion for highly accurate 3D orientation, quaternions, Euler angles, etc.
